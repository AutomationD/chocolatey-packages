    <description>VMware Tools is a suite of utilities that enhances the performance of the virtual machine's guest operating system and improves management of the virtual machine. Without VMware Tools installed in your guest operating system, guest performance lacks important functionality. Installing VMware Tools eliminates or improves these issues:
    
        Low video resolution
        Inadequate color depth
        Incorrect display of network speed
        Restricted movement of the mouse
        Inability to copy and paste and drag-and-drop files
        Missing sound
        Provides the ability to take quiesced snapshots of the guest OS
        Synchronizes the time in the guest operating system with the time on the host
        Provides support for guest-bound calls created with the VMware VIX API
        VMware Tools includes these components:
        VMware Tools service
        VMware device drivers
        VMware user process
        VMware Tools control panel
